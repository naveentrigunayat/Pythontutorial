Question:
Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the values only.

Hints:

Use dict[key]=value pattern to put entry into a dictionary.
Use ** operator to get power of a number.
Use range() for loops.
Use keys() to iterate keys in the dictionary. Also we can use item() to get key/value pairs.

Solution

'''
def printDict():
	d=dict()
	for i in range(1,21):
		d[i]=i**2
	for (k,v) in d.items():	
		print(v)
		

printDict()
