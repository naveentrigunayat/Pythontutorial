Array
List
Tuple
Set
Dictionary




#                                       Array


Array is beneficial if you need to store group of elements of same datatype.
Array uses less memory than list



#                                          List


List is beneficial if you need to store group of elements of same or different datatype.
Lists are mutable so we can modify it’s element.
List uses more memory than Array.



#                                          Tuple


Tuple is beneficial if you need to store group of elements of same or different datatype.
Tuples are immutable so we can not modify it’s element.
Tuples are used to store data which should not be modified. 
It occupies less memory compare to list.



#                                Set


Set is beneficial if you need to store unordered group of elements of same or different datatype.
A set does not accept duplicate elements. 
Sets are mutable so we can modify it’s element.
Sets are unordered so we can not access its element using index.



#                                Dictionary


Dictionary is beneficial if you need to store elements in the form of key-value pair of same or different datatype.
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection.
Dictionaries are mutable so we can modify it’s item.
