#                                 Pass Statement

Pass Statement is used to do nothing. It can be used inside a loop or if statement to represent no operation. 
Pass is useful when we need statement syntactically correct but we do not want to do any operation.

if(condition):               <----- If this condition is True 
	pass              <-----  Do not perform any operation
else:
	Statements         ,---- So Only else will execute when condition False



#                               Pass Statement


while condition:
	if(condition):
		pass
	Statements
Rest of Code
