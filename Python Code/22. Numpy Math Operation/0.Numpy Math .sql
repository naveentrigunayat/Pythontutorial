#                                   Mathematical Operations on Arrays using numpy


We can perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc on the elements of an array. Math functions from the math module can also be possible to apply to the elements of the array. 
Ex:- 
a = array([101, 102, 103, 104, 105])
a = a + 5 

a = array([101, 102, 103, 104, 105])
b = array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
c = a + b
